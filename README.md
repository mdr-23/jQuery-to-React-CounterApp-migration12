# Counter App - jQuery to React Migration

This is a migration of the Counter App from jQuery to React. The original implementation used jQuery for handling the counter functionality, and now it has been migrated to React, utilizing React's state and event handling.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Migration Process

The migration involved the following steps:

1. Set up a new React project using `create-react-app`.
2. Created a new `App` component as the entry point of the application.
3. Refactored the HTML structure of the counter using React components and JSX syntax.
4. Replaced the jQuery code with React state and event handlers.
5. Created a new `useState` hook to manage the count state.
6. Implemented the functionality to increment and decrement the count based on user interactions.
7. Added CSS styles to achieve the desired counter layout and appearance.
8. Tested the application to ensure that the counter functionality works as expected.

## Usage

To use the Counter App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Acknowledgements

This migration was done as a learning exercise to understand the process of migrating from jQuery to React. The original Counter App was created using jQuery and served as a basis for the migration process.

## Conclusion

The migration from jQuery to React has allowed us to take advantage of the benefits of a modern JavaScript framework, such as improved performance, better organization of code, and easier maintenance. React's components and hooks provide a more structured and declarative approach to building interactive UIs.

By completing this migration, we have successfully transformed the original jQuery-based application into a more scalable, maintainable, and efficient React application.
